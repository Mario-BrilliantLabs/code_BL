# **Activity 6**

Welcome to Cyberville

You will be asked to create a small classroom model of a smart community with the concepts learned using as many of the electronic and technological resources included in the kit as possible. The goal here will be to let students create their vision of a smart city using the materials in the kit and as needed recycled materials

We encourage you to be creative, innovative and go as far as possible. The size of your model can vary from one square metre (1 m2) or more depending on the space you have available and the interest of the students in making this activity a large group project. You can build small houses, roads, municipal services and public transportation. If possible, you can use materials that you already have at school such as small robots, lego blocks or other. For example, there could be traffic signs, remote controlled doors and lights, automatic traffic lights, moving vehicles and installations controlled by the Internet of Things.

At the end of the creation, we will ask you to make a small report that you can send us by email. We leave it up to you to decide how you would like to present your work and your smart city to us. We invite you to include photographs and comments that explain what you learned and how it works and the different parts of your smart city with its name and components.

We had such a great time creating our small community. With objects all around our place, we managed to build something really exciting. Try it yourself and put your imagination at work.
